Graphene is a lightweight and modular framework for building runtime user interfaces with Unity's [UI Toolkit][0f273cb2].

## Intro

Graphene **superconducts** your creativity for efficiently building modern interactive UI for your games. It takes care of the heavy lifting by providing a framework inspired by Web standards, right into Unity.

It's **lightweight** and modular - you get to pick and choose which parts you need for your projects.

- **Dynamic Hierarchy**: Use the familiar GameObjects-based workflow to author the high-level hierarchy. The UI tree is built to reflect the GameObject hierarchy, using `Views` to designate sections of the screen, or components.
- **Template Composition**: Reuse your static assets by writing atomic components, and dynamically compose them in runtime.
- **Attribute-Based**: Instruct your UI to both draw _and_ bind templates using any data-container with a `[Bind]` attribute. Primitives, objects, collections, one-way, two-way binding, specific control selection: the parts you'll be most frequently developing with in C# are  exposed via attributes
- **State-Based Routing**: Use the GameObject hierarchy dynamically construct your router's states. Its functionality mimics url-based addresses: `index/settings/video`.

It comes with a **component-kit** library, many VisualElement extensions and a sample application to get you started.
